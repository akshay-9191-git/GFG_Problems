## 01. At Least K Occurrences

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/first-element-to-occur-k-times5150/1)

### Problem Description

**Task:** Given an array arr[] and an integer k, find the first element that occurs at least k times in the array.If multiple elements satisfy the condition, return the element whose k-th occurrence appears earliest in the array.If no element occurs at least k times, return -1.Examples:Input: arr[] = [1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7], k = 2

#### Examples

##### Example 1

- **Output:**
```text
4
```
- **Explanation:** Both 7 and 4 occur twice. However, 4 reaches its second occurrence before 7, so the answer is 4.Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4], k = 3Output: 3Explanation: The element 3 is the only element that occurs at least 3 times in the array.Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 2], k = 10Output: -1Explanation: No element occurs at least 10 times in the array.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n)

        unordered_map<int , int> mp;
        for(int x:arr){
            mp[x]++;
            if(mp[x] == k){
                return x;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
